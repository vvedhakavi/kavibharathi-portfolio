			<h2>About Me</h2>
			<h4>Hi, My name is Kavibharathi</h4>
			<p>
				 I’m a Frontend Developer with over 2 years of experience building responsive, user-friendly, and performance-driven web applications. I specialize in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React.js, Bootstrap, and React-Bootstrap, creating clean and modern interfaces that deliver seamless user experiences across all devices. I have worked extensively with component-based architecture, reusable UI patterns, responsive design, API integration, React Router navigation, and performance optimization.

                 Throughout my journey, I’ve developed multiple real-world projects, including product-based web applications, interior design platforms, and organizational websites — ensuring accessibility, speed, and visual consistency. I focus on writing clean, maintainable code and translating user requirements into functional, appealing interfaces. I’m continuously improving my skills in modern frontend ecosystems and excited to explore advanced technologies to build even more engaging digital experiences.
