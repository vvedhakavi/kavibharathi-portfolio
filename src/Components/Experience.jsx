        • Front-End Development: Designed and implemented interactive web
					applications and dashboards for GPS tracking solutions using HTML,
					CSS, JavaScript, and React.js.
					I have developed multiple responsive and user-centric web applications using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Bootstrap, React.js, React-Bootstrap, and React Router, focusing on clean UI, usability, and optimized performance. For Saadhanai Charitable Trust, I built a mobile-first static website that enhanced the trust’s online presence through accessible design and lightweight layouts. For Altima First Aid, I created a dynamic product website using React and React-Bootstrap, implementing reusable components, state management, and responsive interfaces for smooth product browsing. In Dot Interior — SanTraders, I developed a modern interior design platform using HTML5, CSS3 (Flexbox, Grid, animations), and React.js with React Router to deliver a polished, brand-focused, and fully responsive multi-page experience. Across all projects, I collaborated with stakeholders, optimized loading performance, ensured cross-device compatibility, and delivered clean, reliable, and maintainable frontend solutions.
